# AGENTS.md — lane working protocol

How to work in this repo as a dispatched lane — written for any agent CLI
(`claude -p`, `codex exec`, or a human). The dispatch brief carries WHO you
are and WHAT the mission is; this file carries HOW. Read it before any edit.

## Protocol

0. **PLAN FIRST** — before any edit: `eza -T` the directories the mission
   touches (or `git ls-files`) for the shape, then rg the areas it names,
   read the files you would edit and `.qlty/qlty.toml` + the biome rule set.
   Code to the spec — never emit flagged patterns for the gate to catch.
   Note what live lanes already own: the governor denies parallel edits to
   a leased file; re-read and retry, it integrates rather than blocks.
1. **SHATTER JUDGMENT** — if the mission decomposes into 2+ genuinely
   independent scopes, do NOT implement it all here:
   `bun ~/.claude/hooks/suspenders/bin/work.ts split <id> "child one title"
"child two title" --reason independent-scopes --keep 1`, work only the
   kept child, end with `SPLIT <id>` — the fleet refills the rest. A split
   beyond 2 children needs a registered plan item first (`work add "plan: …"`,
   then `split --plan <id>`). Poll your inbox before starting and before
   finishing — `coord inbox --as <sid>` carries coordinator/board messages
   (drawer "send message" delivers there).
2. Work in the worktree + branch your brief names. SMALL anchored edits;
   co-situated tests for new logic; never hand-edit files another live lane
   owns.
3. **GATES** — `qlty fmt` + `qlty check` on changed files → "No issues";
   `bun test` on the files you touched → green.
4. Commit on your branch (subject = the item title), push the branch. NO tags.
5. Finish: `bun ~/.claude/hooks/suspenders/bin/work.ts done <id> --sha <branch-head>`.

Final line: `DONE <sha>` | `SPLIT <id>` | `BLOCKED` (after 3 honest attempts,
tree restored).

Repo doctrine (quality bar, architecture) lives in CLAUDE.md.
The fleet law set is mirrored in-repo at docs/laws.md — read it before non-trivial work here.

# Repo guide

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Antigravity, etc.) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

A collection of skills for Claude.ai and Claude Code for senior software engineers. Skills are packaged instructions and scripts that extend Claude and your coding agents capabilities.

**Skill curation:** `skills/` holds the actively-maintained set. Skills that fell out of use live in `skills-available/` and are NOT auto-loaded — restore with `git mv skills-available/<name> skills/`. New skills go in `skills/` only if they'll be used; otherwise `skills-available/`. Use `incremental-implementation` for multi-file changes: implement a small slice, test, verify and commit before expanding.

## Creating a New Skill

### Directory Structure

```
skills/
  {skill-name}/           # kebab-case directory name
    SKILL.md              # Required: skill definition
    scripts/              # Required: executable scripts
      {script-name}.sh    # Bash scripts (preferred)
  {skill-name}.zip        # Required: packaged for distribution
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Skill directory**: `kebab-case` (e.g. `web-quality`)
- **SKILL.md**: Always uppercase, always this exact filename
- **Scripts**: `kebab-case.sh` (e.g., `deploy.sh`, `fetch-logs.sh`)
- **Zip file**: Must match directory name exactly: `{skill-name}.zip`

### SKILL.md Format

````markdown
---
name: { skill-name }
description:
  {
    One sentence describing when to use this skill. Include trigger phrases like "Deploy my app",
    "Check logs",
    etc.,
  }
---

# {Skill Title}

{Brief description of what the skill does.}

## How It Works

{Numbered list explaining the skill's workflow}

## Usage

```bash
bash /mnt/skills/user/{skill-name}/scripts/{script}.sh [args]
```
````

**Arguments:**

- `arg1` - Description (defaults to X)

**Examples:**
{Show 2-3 common usage patterns}

## Output

{Show example output users will see}

## Present Results to User

{Template for how Claude should format results when presenting to users}

## Troubleshooting

{Common issues and solutions, especially network/permissions errors}

````

### Best Practices for Context Efficiency

Skills are loaded on-demand — only the skill name and description are loaded at startup. The full `SKILL.md` loads into context only when the agent decides the skill is relevant. To minimize context usage:

- **Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines** — put detailed reference material in separate files
- **Write specific descriptions** — helps the agent know exactly when to activate the skill
- **Use progressive disclosure** — reference supporting files that get read only when needed
- **Prefer scripts over inline code** — script execution doesn't consume context (only output does)
- **File references work one level deep** — link directly from SKILL.md to supporting files

### Script Requirements

- Use `#!/bin/bash` shebang
- Use `set -e` for fail-fast behavior
- Write status messages to stderr: `echo "Message" >&2`
- Write machine-readable output (JSON) to stdout
- Include a cleanup trap for temp files
- Reference the script path as `/mnt/skills/user/{skill-name}/scripts/{script}.sh`

### Creating the Zip Package

After creating or updating a skill:

```bash
cd skills
zip -r {skill-name}.zip {skill-name}/
````

### End-User Installation

Document these two installation methods for users:

**Claude Code:**

```bash
cp -r skills/{skill-name} ~/.claude/skills/
```

**claude.ai:**
Add the skill to project knowledge or paste SKILL.md contents into the conversation.

If the skill requires network access, instruct users to add required domains at `claude.ai/settings/capabilities`.
